# STAR Advisement Tool Frontend

The STAR Advisement Tool (SAT for short) is a web application that helps community college transfer students to plan their courses in a Cal State LA program with or without the help of an advisor. There are two ways SAT can be used for advisement, which we refer to as Pre-Transfer Advisement and Post-Transfer Advisement.

This project is a React application bootstrapped with Vite. It offers a fast development experience and is optimized for performance.
